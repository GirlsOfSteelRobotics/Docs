Testing this again

Follow the link above to read our programmer's documentation:
* Setting up the Eclipse programming environment
* Working with Git and GitHub
* Troubleshooting problems

_Note: This repository is dedicated to the documentation kept in wiki pages, so it shouldn't contain any Java code. 
Use the season-specific repositories for storing Eclipse projects._

This is a test of merging changes from multiple branches using a Pull Request. -Joe.
